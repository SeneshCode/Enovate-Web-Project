            The project conducted by the group involves developing a business model for Energy Ecotec, a company
            dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and supplying high-quality solar panels for various applications in
            Sri Lanka. The project includes elements such as proposing designations for key roles within the modeled
            business, describing different departments and components of the business model, outlining a flow chart to
            demonstrate the interaction between components, and providing a detailed description of the business model
            and its objectives. Additionally, the project requires the inclusion of photographs to prove the
            participation of all group members in the development of the business model.
